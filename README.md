# decodeChallenge
a fun JS challenge assigned to the class to solve...Feel free to try it yourself before looking at the solution! And yes...I'm mad at myself for hard-coding the alphabet twice...

Directions: Two minions of an evil overlord are passing secret letters back and forth to each other. There code takes every lowercase letter and translates it to the letter at the opposite side of the alphabet (i.e. 'a' becomes 'z', 'b' becomes 'y', etc.). All uppercase letters, punctuations, and whitespace stay the same. Write a function that takes a coded string in and outputs the decoded message.
